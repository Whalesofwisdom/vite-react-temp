# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This template implements a service-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### Core Layers

1. Database Layer
   - SQLite with Drizzle ORM
   - Type-safe schema definitions
   - Migration management
   - Query logging and monitoring

2. Service Layer
   - UserService: Authentication and profile management
   - EntryService: Content management
   - Error handling and validation
   - Type-safe operations

3. Utility Layer
   - Logging system
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error handling
   - Type definitions

## Key Components

Database (src/db)
- Schema definitions
- Migration management
- Connection handling
- Query logging

Services (src/services)
- UserService
- EntryService
- Future services follow same pattern

Utils (src/utils)
- Logger: Centralized logging
- Errors: Custom error types
- Performance: Operation monitoring

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for database
- Test utilities and helpers
- Automated test runs

## Security Features
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Access control
- Performance monitoring
